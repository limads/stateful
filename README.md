# About

This crate exports traits useful for a few design patterns common in GUI development,
with abstractions built only using the standard library, such as:

- **Verify** Implemented by objects that most uphold some condition.

- **Callbacks**/**ValuedCallbacks** Synchonous Signal/Slots (late binding) mechanism, built on RefCell/Rc.

- **Inherit** Java-style inheritance trait.

- **Transition** Implements the typestate pattern.

A few other traits are still a work in progress.
